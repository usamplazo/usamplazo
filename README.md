### Hi there 👋, Gligorije
#### A passionate backend developer from Serbia.
I loved computers from an early age, which opened the door to programming in one moment. Now I enjoy learning new programming languages and frameworks and expanding my knowledge every day. I’m curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different direction.
